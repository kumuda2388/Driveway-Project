Contributions:

I Kumuda Krishnappa and Nikila Choppa collaborated closely on this project, and hereâ€™s a summary of our contributions:

We jointly designed the necessary tables, determining what data was required and what could be excluded. 

While I handled the creation of submit requests, quotes, bills, and orders on the customer side and Nikila worked on the same features for the contractor side (David).

Both of us worked together on the queries for the dashboard and its overall creation.

Throughout the project, we coordinated effectively, discussing issues, troubleshooting challenges, and supporting each other whenever we encountered difficulties. If we were unable to resolve an issue on our own, we worked together to find a solution.

While we each focused on our individual tasks, we also collaborated on certain components and ensured that all parts of the project were integrated and functioning smoothly.
